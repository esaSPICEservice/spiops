**pynkpandas** is a plugin for **pynk** - a core python wrapper for MUSTLink. It has as main purpose to bridge **pynk** with **pandas** for data science and analysis.
It means that it should not perform requests to the API itself. If you need to perform additional requests that are not supported by **pynk** consider to contribute there instead.


The contribution on the project follows the [Gitlab workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/).

Create tickets for every contribution that you plan. Branch the development branch using the issue identifier on it (you can do it automatically from Gitlab GUI) and ask for a merge request when you finish. The maintainer team will have a look on your contribution and integrate it on the common code trunck when possible.

You can also create tickets for issues that you do not plan to solve. This is absolutely fine and a good way to keep a backlog of open/pending issues.
