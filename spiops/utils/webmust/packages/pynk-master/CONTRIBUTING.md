**pynk** is a core python wrapper. It means that it is not supposed that the library returns non-standard python objects. Consider to create a plug-in using **pynk** as a dependency if you wish to have specific data representations.

The contribution on the project follows the [Gitlab workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/).

Create tickets for every contribution that you plan. Branch the development branch using the issue identifier on it (you can do it automatically from Gitlab GUI) and ask for a merge request when you finish. The maintainer team will have a look on your contribution and integrate it on the common code trunck when possible.

You can also create tickets for issues that you do not plan to solve. This is absolutely fine and a good way to keep a backlog of open/pending issues.

You can also report problems affecting **MUSTLink REST-API** itself. Just ensure that you use the label 'API' for the effect.
